This paragraph is removed by remark-toc. However, a rule such as
`no-consecutive-blank-lines` cannot see this node as it has no
position. **remark-lint** knows that this node has no positional
information and can ignore the space between the ToC heading
and next node, thus ignoring any messages between nodes.
